# Disclaimer
This code is almost 2 years old (and not maintained), probably doesn't work anymore, and has pastebin links which you'll need to change accordingly if you want to put this to use. I made this project because I was interested in some malware at the time that injected code in the Discord JavaScript files that run on startup. This should only be used for educational purposes.
